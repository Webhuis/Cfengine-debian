    THE FRONTIER ARTISTIC LICENSE Version 1.0
    Copyright Â© (c) 1999 by Samuel Reynolds.
    Derived from the "Artistic License" at "OpenSource.org".
    Submitted to OpenSource.org for Open Source Initiative certification.

    PREAMBLE

    The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
    Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
    semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
    while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
    the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to
    make reasonable modifications.

    DEFINITIONS

    o   "Package" refers to the script, suite, file, or collection of scripts, 
        suites, and/or files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and to 
        derivatives of that Package created through textual modification.

    o   "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been 
        modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the 
        Copyright Holder.

    o   "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright statement or 
        statements for the package.

    o   "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this 
        Package.

    o   "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of 
        media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on.  
        (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but 
        only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the 
        fee.)

    o   "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, 
        though there may be fees involved in handling the item.  It also means 
        that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same 
        conditions they received it.

    TERMS

    1.  You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the 
        Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you 
        duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

    2.  You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes, and other modifications 
        derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package 
        modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

    3.  You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided 
        that you insert a prominent notice in each changed script, suite, or file 
        stating how and when you changed that script, suite, or file, and provided 
        that you do at least ONE of the following:

        a) Use the modified Package only within your corporation or 
        organization, or retain the modified Package solely for personal use.
    
        b) Place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them 
        Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an 
        equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site 
        such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your 
        modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
    
        c) Rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict 
        with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a 
        separate manual page (or equivalent) for each non-standard executable 
        that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
    
        d) Make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

    4.  You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or 
        executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

        a) Distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, 
        together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where 
        to get the Standard Version.
    
        b) Accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the 
        Package with your modifications.
    
        c) Accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding 
        Standard Version executables, give the non-standard executables 
        non-standard names, and clearly document the differences in manual 
        pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the 
        Standard Version.
    
        d) Make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
    
    5.  You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this 
        Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package.  
        You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However, you may 
        distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) 
        programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution 
        provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.
    
    6.  The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as 
        output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under 
        the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and 
        may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.
    
    7.  Scripts, suites, or programs supplied by you that depend on or 
        otherwise make use of this Package shall not be considered part of this 
        Package.
    
    8.  The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote 
        products derived from this software without specific prior written 
        permission.

    9.  THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED 
        WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
        MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
