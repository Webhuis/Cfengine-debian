There are some tweaks which were applied to the standard cfengine3 installation
and you should be aware of them:

*) cfengine3 is FHS, that means that, unlike the original, we log in /var/log,
the binaries are located in /usr/sbin; for upstream compatibility we have the
following symlinks:

/etc/cfengine3 -> /var/lib/cfengine3/inputs
/usr/sbin      -> /var/lib/cfengine3/binÂ§

*) to enable the daemons you need to modify /etc/default/cfengine3 and set the
proper variables; the daemons won't be started unless there is an
/etc/cfengine3/promises.cf file present; if you want to test that everything is
working you can do:

cp /usr/share/doc/cfengine3/examples/example_config/* /etc/cfengine3/

At this point you MUST adapt /etc/cfengine3/site.cf to your needs, you may want
to remove the blank auth for the user 'mark' (the author of cfengine), and
anything that update your config files

When everything is ready you can start the daemons:
/etc/init.d/cfengine3 start

*) By default we are not starting any daemon, in most of your installations you
will only need the cfagent with a proper configuration file

*) For more info you should have a look at the reference manual and the relevant
docs:
