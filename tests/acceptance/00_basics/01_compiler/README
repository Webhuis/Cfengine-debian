This suite of tests is essentially 5 different tests repeated for various
attributes.

1) prove that the test case works
2) show that it fails as expected with an illegal value
3) attempt to show failure when that illegal value is a parameter to the body
4) attempt to show failure when that illegal value is a parameter to the bundle
5) attempt to show failure when that illegal value is a parameter to a method

These tests are slightly different, but also address issues in constraint
checking
